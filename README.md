# **Growth and Mindset**
*Growth and mindset to me is training your brain to not get discouraged when things get tough. 
1. Always challange yourself to continue to learn and better yourself. 
1. You should always approach all situations with a positivity and confidence. 
1. Always try to learn from each situation regardless of the outcome.*
