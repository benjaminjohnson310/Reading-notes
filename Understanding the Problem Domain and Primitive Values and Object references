Some people ask what the hardest part of writing code is. I have learned that the hardest part is learning the problem domain. This is true because it is difficult to solve a problem when you dont know the problem. Solving a coding problem has been compared to solving a jigsaw puzzle without a picture. The traditional steps you would take are thrown out the window because you dont quite know where to start. Problem domains have been compared to a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture. If you understand the problem domain, then that makes programming much easier.

It is very important to know the difference between Primitive Values and Object References. All data types in JavaScript are either in the primitive values or object reference categories. It is critical to know the difference if you want to master JavaScript. There are 7 primitive values. They consist of Boolean, null, undefined, number, bigInt, String, and symbol. Then you have Objects as a data type. The key difference is Immutable and Mutable Data. Primitive values are immutable while object references are Mutable. Primitive Values contain actual values while variables set to object references just contain references or memory addresses. An example is like a street address. It tells you where the house is located but nothing much about the house. That would be an object reference. Who lives in the house and what color it is or how many rooms it has is an example of Primitive  Values. 
To learn more about these topics, I would recommend w3schools.
